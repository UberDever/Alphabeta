Alphabeta is framework library written in C, oriented for games and 2d/3d graphics. It is cross-platform, lightweight and easy to use/integrate. Written with SDL2.
# Modules
+ Alpha - contains basic logic for window handling (creation, context, keyboard and mouse), logging and generic stuff
+ Beta - basic asset manager (not implemented)
+ Gamma - responsible for all graphics in application (2d primitives, text, renderer)
+ Delta - generic most frequently used data structures: vector, hashmap, stack, queue, deck.
+ Pi - all sorts of mathematics, that can be useful in 2d/3d application
+ Omega - basic UI, oriented for games (not implemented in this particular project, see [CREN](https://github.com/UberDever/CREN))
# Features
Alphabeta grants some basic graphics functionality in C, with which you can develop 2d and 3d applications without writing your own tools.
It can render primitives and text with hardcoded fonts. Also it handles all input
so you can check any state of any button on keyboard and any property of mouse in very simple way.
# Purpose
It was first develop experience in this kind of program and it is not ment to be used in current state. Some modules are missing components, 
some not implemented at all. Regardless of that, Alphabeta is used across some of my projects, including
[Spicy](https://github.com/UberDever/spicy) and [Ind3d](https://github.com/UberDever/ind3d).
This project has given me the useful experience and basic understanding of engine/framework developing
